## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = residual_sugar, y = alcohol, color = as.factor(quality))) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  facet_wrap(~quality)
```
```{r}
df %>% ggplot(aes(x = quality)) + 
df <- read.csv("data/clean/wine_quality.csv")  geom_histogram()
```

```{r}
hist_plotter <- function (x) {
if(is.numeric(df$x)){
df %>% 
 ggplot(aes(x ={{x}} , fill = factor(quality))) + 
  geom_histogram(position = "dodge", bins = 50) +
  facet_wrap(~quality)
}

}
map(names(df), hist_plotter)
```
